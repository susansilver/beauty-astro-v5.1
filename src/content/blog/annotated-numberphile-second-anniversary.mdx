 This series on Numberphile continues. I'm personally annotating videos with my favorite memories. This time we tackle the second anniversary year. It features two of the great mathematcian's, John Conway and Ron Graham. Numberphile was hitting its stride. Future years will have interviews with mathamatcian's like Terrenace Tao and several other field medalists. 
 
 It's this year that the channel hits 1 million subscribers and Brady unleashes the "Mile of Pi."

## The Playlist

Here is the playlist of the second anniversary videos. They are in order of publication date. The personal annotations are numbered by the video's position in the playlist for easy reference. You can [view this playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLL_2f0y97l8faLkerCnb5uQoxnEoyjdn&si=0jRFnVH7ypR9QKAS). 

There are 73 videos and the total playlist time is about 10 hours and 40 minutes. In the top right corner of the playlist embed, there is a hamburger menu. Clicking this will allow you to navigate to any video in the playlist.

Simon Singh returns with this bit on Futurama (which is my favorite tv show of all time.) Singh reveals the abundance of refrences to the taxicab number, 1729. This is a reference to the mathematcian Ramanujan. It is an ecellent discussion of how the writers decided to insert these niche jokes that only a few would get. 

If you love this story, you may like this [cross stitch pattern for the taxicab number 1729](/patterns/Taxicab-Number.pdf). 

(14) Why do people hate mathematics?

This is a video with Edward Frenkel. I like the comparison he makes early on to literature and art. Because I make this comparison all the time. I feel he highlights many of the things that I do when talking about math. Mainly, that we need to find ways to [connect math to meaning in people's personal lives](/a-writers-illicit-love-affair-with-mathematics). I would also add, that we need to help people process their math trauma and help them overcome math anxiety. 

(15) Topology of a Twisted Torus

This is one of the few Numberphile videos that tackles the art of mathematics. Professor Carlo Séquin discusses the art of Keizo Ushio who did a sculpture of the twisted torus in this video. Ushio specializes in carving mobius strips out of granite! Séquin took this idea further and imagined other ways you could cut a torus and make more links and different twists. These prototypes are innovative and beautiful. My [cross stitch patterns](/downloads) are my expression of math art.

(20)(21) Interviews with John Conway about the Game of Life

The Game of Life is one of those pop-culture math refrences that some people are exposed to. I find [stories about it pop up from time to time](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2407617-decades-old-mathematical-mystery-about-the-game-of-life-finally-solved/) in mainstream publications. People seem to find it facinating. Unfortunately, Conway passed away in 2020 from Covid. We are fortunate that we have these conversations to remember him.  

Unexpectedly, Conway discusses his friendship with Martin Gardner. This is how I learned that Gardner's first great hit was an article for Scientific American on [hexaflexagons](https://martin-gardner.org/SciAm1.html). So popular that he became a regular columnist! (His column on the Game of Life was popular too.)
