I am so honored to get the chance to host the [Carnival of Mathematics](https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/). This year, I’ve endeavored to connect more with the math community online and elsewhere. My big epiphany was finally understanding that I [need to connect over my math feelings](https://beautyofmathematics.com/math-communication-as-rebellion/) to be happy. 

I am so grateful for everyone who speaks to others about mathematics. I learn so much this way. 

Here are the posts submitted this month. 



1. [Nursery Rhymes for Curious Minds](https://medium.com/@vanessamadu/nursery-rhymes-for-curious-minds-the-queen-of-hearts-messes-up-her-tarts-43580870a2d3) by Vanessa Madu

In this article, Vanessa teaches us about Bayesian Statistics. She uses the rhyming scheme of a poem we are familiar with about the Queen of Hearts and her tarts. You will have to read to understand her conclusion and its meaning. G.W. Leibniz



2. [The Irish logarithm](https://blog.plover.com/math/irish-logarithm.html) by Mark Dominus

Mark introduces the Irish logarithm from Percy Ludgate. It presents a way to do multiplication. It isn’t the most efficient way. It is still easier to use a multiplication table. It does have an advantage in computing. Mark catalogs the reasons why. 



3. [Basic epidemiological modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYXElVZrayU) by Zeb Mason

This short video explains the modeling of an epidemic. It presents the model as a card game you can play. Something you can do with a pack of cards. Zeb explains what each column means as the game goes on. It provides a visual representation of different aspects of the model. 



4. [Praeclarum Theorema](https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/2023/10/05/praeclarum-theorema-a/) by Jon Awbrey

In this article, Jon presents the praeclarum theorem or splendid theorem by G.W. Leibniz. Sharing Leibniz’s original proof. As well as providing a more modern proof. 



5. [One “Big Rule” To Rule Them](https://karendcampe.wordpress.com/2023/10/13/one-big-rule-to-rule-them-all/) All by Karen Campe 

Karen presents some of the ways she teaches math using one big rule. The idea is to generalize information and strengthen conceptual learning. Providing a more complete picture made from the details they are learning. Adding depth to the subject. 



6. [What is the maximum number of Tverberg’s partitions?](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2023/10/24/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-tverbergs-partitions/) by Gil Kalai

I’ll admit this one is more advanced than what I currently know in math. The basis of this post is from a recent speech in Budapest.  This is one of Gil's favorite theorems. He goes on to explain the problem. I still find this type of math exciting even if I can’t decipher it. 


7. [When did Math Get So Hard- Part 2](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/10/when-did-math-get-so-hard-part-2.html) by Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch

Some mathematics needs prerequisites presenting a barrier even to experienced mathematicians. This is because of the knowledge built over time. Requiring a deeper understanding. 

8. [Embeddings: What they are and why they matter](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/) by Simon Willson

This is a long-form article that goes in-depth about the applications of embeddings. I love the example offered at the beginning on how it works by explaining how a related post feature was added to the blog. Many examples are given to show what is out there and how embeddings are being used. 

Here are some things that I read or watched in October. 



9. [What is algebraic geometry?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MflpyJwhMhQ) by Aleph 0

I watched this video and fell in love with a branch of mathematics. I’ve always wondered what I might study as a mathematician if I went back to school. This is undoubtedly it. 



10. [A Brief Collection of Math Metaphors in Literature](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2023/10/30/a-brief-collection-of-math-metaphors-in-literature/) by Ben Orlin

As a writer, I am always intrigued by the ways that math and language crossover. This is a nice collection of quotes from books that showcase this. If you like this sort of thing, I’ve made [a playlist of math references in songs](https://beautyofmathematics.com/math-love-songs/). 



11. [Lost in numbers: As NYC educators look to overcome dyslexia, some wonder what will be done to help those with the math disability dyscalculia ](https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-educators-overcome-dyslexia-dyscalculia-math/)by Megan McGibney

This is one of the more interesting news articles that I’ve read about dyscalculia. If you don’t know, this is a learning disability related to mathematics. It is still not well known. It is important to make people more aware, especially math teachers and parents. This [Numberpile video has more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_Hqdqe84Uc). 

One of my goals is to [aid mathematicians and scientists in writing more for the public by starting blogs](https://fancycomma.com/2022/03/05/why-you-should-start-a-science-blog-this-year/). In this regard, I’m planning on doing a blog challenge in January 2024. It is a basic blogging course that will be free. If this interests you drop me an email at [mathcomm@susansilver.net](mailto:mathcomm@susansilver.net) and I’ll let you know when it is live.
