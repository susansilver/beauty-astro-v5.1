Today is a special day in the Indian yearly calendar. It marks the celebration of mathematics in that country.
 It also marks the anniversary of the birth of Srinivasa Ramanujan.

Ramanujan was a genius mathematician who was obsessed with mathematics his whole life. He was largely self-taught.
 He kept notebooks where he performed investigations and found some solutions re-discovered and new.

He [saw math in his dreams and believed](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/srinivasa-ramanujan-life-story-973662-2017-04-26) them to be from his 
Goddess Mahalakshmi of Namakkal.

## <a name="WhatISharewithRamanujan"></a> What I Share with Ramanujan

Learning this about Ramanujan made me feel a little closer to him. I also have math dreams. 
I can never predict when they will come but they are so immersive. I cannot explain what it is like to view 
the world from the position of being a graph. Something impossible to experience in the real world but very possible in dreams.

The other connection that I have is the [mathematician G.H. Hardy.](https://beautyofmathematics.com/truth-hardy/) To pursue his dreams,
 Ramanujan wrote to many people at Cambridge. Hardy was the first to recognize he was dealing with a mathematical genius and brought 
 him to the UK. Together they did profound work and it is one of the most celebrated partnerships in math history.

You can read [Ramanujan's story](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/1476763496) in the book, 
"The Man Who Knew Infinity." This was also translated to screen by the same title starring Jeremy Irons as Hardy and 
Dev Petal as Ramanujan.

By the way, I have a pattern for the Taxicab number if you wish to sew it as a bookmark.

## <a name="WhatisNationalMathematicsDay"></a> What is National Mathematics Day?

National Mathematics Day was first celebrated on December 22nd, 2012. It was declared a holiday 
in India for the 125th anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan's birth. In 2017, the 
[Ramanujan Math Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_Math_Park) was opened. Similar 
to [our MoMath](https://momath.org/) full of interactive learning.

This stamp was issued to commemorate the first National Mathematics Day.

## <a name="StartingmyStampCollection"></a> Starting my Stamp Collection

My father passed away a few years back. He started collecting stamps when he was very young. His mother wanted him to start 
the hobby to learn geography. I remembered him sharing his albums with me when I was growing up.

I asked my stepmother to send me his collection if she ever found it. I did not know how extensive it was. This year she mailed
 me three boxes worth of stamps and coins.

My father and I weren't close. We didn't see eye to eye on most things though we did love each other. Things got better in my 
later years as we started to reach a mutual understanding. Unfortunately, I was never really able to repair our relationship as 
time ran out for us.

This stamp collection is one connection that I still have with my dad. So it felt right to add to the collection and make it ours. 
That's how I came to purchase three different stamps from India on ebay that all celebrate Ramanujan including this National 
Mathematics Day stamp. Finally, something we can do together.
