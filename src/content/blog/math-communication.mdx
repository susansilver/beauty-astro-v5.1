**Math communication exists.** _Period_.

[@FancyComma ](https://twitter.com/fancycomma) asked:

“What do you think, #SciCommers, about #MathComm? Does that even exist? @Susan_Silver”

It seems people make this assumption without doing any research. But, maybe this is the problem we have in STEM. It seems, at least to me, that people do not seek out information on math.

In my opinion, this is most likely due to the prevalence of[ math anxiety](https://beautyofmathematics.com/what-math-anxiety-feels-like/). Along with societal views that it is okay not to care about mathematics. There are people like [my mother who purposely choose her major in college so she would not have to do any math](https://beautyofmathematics.com/a-writers-illicit-love-affair-with-mathematics/).

## An Epic List of Math Communication Resources <a name="an-epic-list-of-math-communication-resources"></a>

I did respond to this Tweet with a ton of resources but I left out a lot of things. A lot of people. A lot of mathematicians work to inform and entertain the public about mathematics. I have gathered all the resources that I know of to make an epic list of math communicators.

I’m organizing this list by category.

1. My hope is that this can act as an entryway into mathematics for math anxious people.
2. Or help connect more people in science communications.
3. As well as provide a resource for math teachers and parents who want to help their children with math.

If there is something you want to add to the list or you want more information then connect with me by [sending an email.](mailto:hello@susansilver.com)

Not all resources are family friendly. Please check them out before sharing them with children.

I will also say that this list probably has a UK bias. This is because I mostly watch [Numberphile](https://beautyofmathematics.com/favorite-video-every-year-numberphile/).

This list appears on [Notion](https://suzza-silver.notion.site/suzza-silver/Epic-List-of-Math-Communicators-d2fee910dc5c4b92bb9f439c6ffd9550) and as a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/susansilver/math-communications). You can easily duplicate these items for your own use using these websites.

### Television <a name="television"></a>

1. There is a television show you can watch right now. It will entertain you and get you laughing about mathematics. It also happens to be my favorite tv show of all time, **Futurama**.

   [Many gags are easy to miss because they appear on screen so briefly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJDiZi9dqOg) They are often references to mathematics. If you want to see what I mean, watch the episode “The Prisoner of Benda.” The premise is a legit mathematical theorem developed for the episode. Written by a staff writer who was also a mathematician, Ken Keeler. You can [watch it in the US on Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/watch/c4c99ba0-213f-4f8f-9245-edc45c1c4232) (Season 7, Episode 10.)

2. When I was a kid, I would watch Saturday Morning Cartoons. So hard to believe that isn’t a thing anymore. It was during this time that ABC would show **Schoolhouse Rock!** segments. Doing research for this, I discovered that [they did a 50th anniversary special this year](https://abc.com/news/insider/watch-schoolhouse-rock-50th-anniversary-singalong-abc-app-hulu-disney-plus). You can catch clips on YouTube but [you can stream them all on Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/schoolhouse-rock/4AbEzzTxhWxZ). This is my favorite song from what they call Multiplication Rock.

   <YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulRpKn8aPRU" />

3. **SquareOne TV** is a show that aired on my local PBS station when I was a kid. It was a children’s show that was all about mathematics. I was able to learn the rules for adding and subtracting negative numbers by watching it. You can still find clips on YouTube.

   [Here is a playlist of the episodes from the first season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-vPvGoB6YA&list=PLFk84PZ1x_cM49WGDG1sCaial9kFyeUvT)

4. Of course, we cannot forget The Count from **Sesame Street**! This is a children’s show that teaches about numbers and letters. Here is a [40 minute compilation of sketches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnBlIuJdJxE) from different years of the show.
5. This one comes from over the pond, **QI**. Which stands for Quite Interesting. This is a panel show where contestants don’t guess the right answer. They come up with the most interesting or funny ones. It was originally hosted by Stephen Fry but now it is Sandi Toksvig. The show features many science questions, and of course, mathematics from time to time.

### Films <a name="Films"></a>

1. The first one that I want to list is **Stand and Deliver**. I almost forgot about this one but found it when I was doing research. It has an important message about believing in yourself.

   This is what I would tell my younger math anxious self. It matters far less what people think of your abilities. _What matters is what you believe about yourself_. I wish that I had understood that then.

   If you are having a hard time with math, [my emails are open.](mailto:hello@susansilver.net) Let’s talk about it.

2. I would recommend **A Trip to Infinity** which is [a documentary you can watch on Netflix](https://beautyofmathematics.com/a-trip-to-infinity-netflix-documentary-streaming-now/). They do try to explain it in the simplest terms. There are plenty of easter eggs for people who know more. A bit of a spoiler, _some infinities are bigger than others._ ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0))
3. **The Man Who Knew Infinity** is about the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. I’ve read the book and enjoyed the movie. It was dream casting with Dev Patel as Ramanujan. Jeremy Irons wasn’t bad as Hardy either but I still think we [need to move away from the idea that he was cold, shy, and awkward.](https://beautyofmathematics.com/truth-hardy/)
4. I don’t want to leave out **The Dot and the Line**. This cartoon won Best Animated Short Film at the Oscars. It’s based on a story written by Norton Juster (**The Phantom Tollbooth**) and inspired by the book **Flatland.** A good watch for people who like geometry.

   <YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaE4W-OhQmI" />

5. Well, let’s also put the **Phantom Tollbooth** on this list. Butch Patrick plays Milo. Eddie from **The Munsters**. [Features a dodecahedron](https://thephantomtollbooth.fandom.com/wiki/Dodechahedron) which is a platonic solid with twelve faces. It is also known to Role Players as the D12.
6. There is the Disney classic, **Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land**. For whatever reason, the segment on billiards is the one that I remember the most.

<YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdVRvYnqj6w" />

7. **Hidden Figures** is a wonderful movie. It took way too long for this story to make it to the screen. It tells the story of mathematicians [Katherine G. Johnson](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-g-johnson), [Dorothy Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan), and [Mary Jackson](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)>). Three black women whose contributions were vital to the early missions of NASA.
8. I will admit, I have not seen this documentary. I wanted to add it to the list since[ it is about the first woman to win the Fields Medal, Maryam Mirzakhani](http://www.zalafilms.com/secrets/). The movie is **Secrets of the Surface**. It is an important story so I don’t mind recommending it sight unseen. [International Women in Mathematics Day](https://may12.womeninmaths.org/) is on May 12th, Mirzakhani’s birthday. She passed away in 2017.
9. One documentary that I really liked was **Between the Folds** which is about origami. Paper folding often takes on modular and geometric forms, making it great for math art. There is a history of studying the subject in mathematics.

   <YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekPv6osml4I" />

10. This movie is not for kids. If you don’t mind a story that gets dark, then you might like **Pi**. Described as a psychological thriller. I’m not sure if this is exactly a math movie. Though numbers are essential to the plot. I put [some math songs on my playlist](https://beautyofmathematics.com/math-love-songs/) that only feature numbers. So I am going to include this one.

You can find most with a YouTube search on a topic you like. I suggest doing a query for one of your hobbies + mathematics. I bet [there will be a video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjMfGUY9x5M).

#### Music <a name="music"></a>

The first two are musicals that were at [Ed Fringe](https://www.edfringe.com/) in 2022. It looks like the Alan Turing musical is returning in 2023. I hope that [like Six](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49194223), we will get to see them in the US.
Tom Leher is a mathematician who wrote satirical music but also wrote songs about science like [The Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSAaiYKF0cs). Currently, all his songs are in the public domain.

## Summary <a name="Summary"></a>

I bet you are wondering how I know all these resources. I really, really, really, love mathematics [(I’m dropping this Dimension 20 reference](https://www.tiktok.com/@dimension20/video/7138792265979301166)).

- Math communication plays an important role in people’s lives.
- It exposes us to a point of view that is more than a problem in a textbook
- It shows us ways of deriving personal meaning from the subject.
- Places like the National Museum of Mathematics make it tangible and interactive.
- Mathematicians who speak to the public help people relate to the topics they discuss.

Gathering these math comm resources shows the abundance of the community. I was alone in my love of mathematics as a child. With no one to connect to. Through Numberphile, I learned that millions of people feel the same as me.

I absolutely know that I haven’t covered all the math communication resources that are out there. Please [email me](mailto:hello@susansilver.net) if there is anything you would recommend.
