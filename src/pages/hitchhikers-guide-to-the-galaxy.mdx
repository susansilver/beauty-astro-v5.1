## The Hitchhiker's Guide Primer

import Lead from '../components/FortyTwo/Lead.astro';

<Lead>“Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” is a classic
 sci-fi story with a lot of love for the genre. 
 Douglas Adams' satire and absurdity shines 
 in this story. Getting us to laugh about bureaucracy,
  technology, and the meaning of life. </Lead>

  It has also brought us some iconic characters.
   Such as Marvin the Paranoid Android. [Referenced 
   as a title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8AfIeJOxw) on Raidohead’s album “Ok Computer.” 
   There is a messenger named after the character 
   Trillian. Back in the day, it allowed you to
connect to IRC and AIM at the same time in one
application. They are still around and sell 
 it as a [medical service for HIPAA-compliant
     messaging.](https://trillian.im/)

 You will see many pop culture references
 to “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” My favorite 
 is the first full episode of Doctor Who with David Tennant.
  It references the character of Arthur Dent. 
  He spends the majority of the episode in his
   pajamas.

It is a bit of an in-joke as Adams was a writer for
 the show. He penned the episode, [“The Pirate Planet”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Planet)
  which was my first introduction to it in college

## Loving Hitchhiker's Guide

“Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” has had many 
adaptations. Originating as a radio show on the
 BBC in 1978. I am only going to discuss the books 
 and the film as they are the only ones that I have 
 seen.

My first experience with “Hitchhiker's Guide” was 
in high school. My friend’s instant messaging 
username was made of the phrase “the answer is 42.” 
That number has great significance in all versions
 of the story. It is the **answer to the ultimate 
 question of life, the universe, and everything.**

I did not read the novel until college. My best friend
 received a fancy copy containing all the stories 
 with gilded pages. She let me borrow it and I was 
 grateful that this printing was the complete version.
  I didn’t need to seek out the other books. I adore 
  the first two in the series. “The Restaurant at the
   End of the Universe” has a scene that takes place 
   at the titular restaurant. It is one I find very 
   memorable.

What I also like about these books is that they use
 the word penultimate. Which is my favorite word. It
  is a mathy reason too. [That we need a word 
  to describe what comes before the last thing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/penultimate) There are a lot of phrases and words related to the act of counting. 

<FancyBlockquote cite="Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" name="mdi:book-open-variant"> 
 "'So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer program,' said Ford, rather lucidly he thought.

  'Right?' said Zaphod.
  
  'Well,' said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn’t aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one of his problems."

## Hitchhiker's Guide: 42 Years and Counting

The reason why I am writing about “Hitchhiker’s Guide
 to the Galaxy” is that I turn 42 today! Last year 
 was absolute trash for me. I lost all that I cared
  about. Some relationships ended that were a part of
   my support network. It was a total loss.

This year, I am focused on rebuilding my life and 
forging new friendships. I’m taking the first three 
months of this year to think about why I’m blogging 
and how I can best help others. I’ve made a lot of 
changes here that I hope people will notice. I am 
moving my focus to talk about math anxiety 
specifically. You can [read about the changes on the
 About page.](/about)

To celebrate my birthday, I’m watching the 
“Hitchhiker’s Guide” movie with my mother.
 We are getting takeout from my 
 favorite local restaurant. Maybe even follow 
 it up with some episodes of “Black Adder.” 
 A day of [British comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBEOTzNt1Uw) is definitely on brand for me.


I guess the movie [wasn’t as beloved](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy) as other
 versions. This saddens me, the cast for this
  movie was amazing. I mean Stephen Fry, 
  Martin Freeman, Alan Rickman, Sam Rockwell,
   Mos Def, and Zooey Deschanel. If you haven’t seen 
   it, don’t miss this little gem. It didn’t earn 
   an Oscar but it wasn’t a Razzie winner either. 
   It is a good movie to watch when you want to laugh.

## Finding Direction with Hitchhiker's Guide

Well, to end things I want to share my favorite
 quote from all the books in the series.

 <FancyBlockquote cite="Life, the Universe, and Everything" name="mdi:book-open-variant">
 "'The Guide says there is an art to flying', said Ford, 'or rather a knack. 
 The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.'"
 </ FancyBlockquote> 

 The book says the best way to do this is to 
 distract yourself before you hit the ground. 
 So many of my problems would resolve themselves 
 if I used this technique.

Here are two videos from Numberphile about the
 number forty-two.
