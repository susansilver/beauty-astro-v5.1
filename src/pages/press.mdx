Suzza Silver is the writer with the mathematical muse. On Beauty of Mathematics, they take
readers on a journey from math anxiety to math confidence. Aiding them to confront
their feelings and show how they too can fall in love with math.

## A Torrid Love Affair With Math Begins

As a child, Suzza struggled with mathematics.
They had to repeat fourth-grade math because they could not do multiplication. 

That extra year made them. By using a simple substitution code they assigned numbers to letters. This transformed
their equations. When working with letters, they were able to read multiplication problems as sentences. For the 
first time, they understood what that little multiplication symbol represented. 

This allowed Suzza to catch up to their peers in their fifth-grade year. For the full story.
